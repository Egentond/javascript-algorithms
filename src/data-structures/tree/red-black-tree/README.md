# Red-Black Tree Implementation in JavaScript

This repository contains a complete implementation of a Red-Black Tree in JavaScript, as part of the `javascript-algorithms` project. Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree, where each node stores an extra bit representing "color" (red or black). These colors and the tree's structural properties ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions, ensuring that operations are efficient in their time complexity.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add new nodes while maintaining the tree's balanced state.
- **Deletion**: Remove nodes and rebalance the tree as necessary.
- **Search**: Efficiently find nodes in the tree.
- **Traversal**: Supports in-order traversal to view the sorted order of elements.
